# VOTE

## Introduction

We introduce a proposal mechanism on ConsensusX, which is applied by the node to be joined or the node governance committee to publicly vote on the proposal via the verification node. The verification node may vote for “yes”, “no”, “strongly negative” or “abstain” in the specific time period. At least half of the voters must vote for "yes" and the proposal can be passed. If one-quarter of the verification nodes vote "strongly against" or one-third of the verification nodes vote "no", the proposal will be rejected. It also provides extensions to the approval process, supporting the corresponding contract call interface and command line interface.
